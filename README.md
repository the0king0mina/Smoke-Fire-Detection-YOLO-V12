# 🔥 Smoke & Fire Detection using YOLOv12

![YOLO Logo](https://ultralytics.com/images/logo.svg)


An advanced real-time **Smoke and Fire Detection System** built using **YOLOv12** for object detection.  
This project detects smoke and fire in video streams or live camera feeds with high accuracy and speed.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a **deep learning-based fire and smoke detection system** that uses the YOLOv12 model for real-time inference.  
The system can be used for early fire detection in surveillance cameras, industrial safety, and smart cities.
